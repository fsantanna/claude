# Remote Workflow

- I'm currently working remotely.
- I don't have access to Claude CLI, Linux, or any command-line tool.
- I use this workflow under this repository, but I'm working on another
  repository I own:
    - [this] https://github.com/fsantanna-no/claude/
    - [work] https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/
- Never commit to `[this]`. Never create pull requests in `[this]`.
- When I ask you to read this workflow ask me which `<user>/<repo>` to work.
- I may also pass an issue `#N` in `<user>/<repo>`, which can be reached at
    - https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/issues/#N
- The goal is to fix or prompt and make a pull request (PR) to `[work]`:
    - Ask me for credentials when about to create the PR.
- Clone the `[work]` repository locally:
    - It must persist during the whole session.
- First, prepare and save a plan in file `.claude/<plan>.md`:
    - Ask for the name, if not given.
    - It will become part of the PR.
    - It must be updated whenever the plan is modified.
- Last, pull main branch to check if there are any glitches.
- Always use English:
    - In all answers, comments, code, or any other kind of output.
    - Even is I write in Portugues, everything must translate to English.
