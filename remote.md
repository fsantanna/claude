# Remote Workflow

- I'm currently working remotely.
- I don't have access to Claude CLI, Linux, or any command-line tool.
- I use this workflow under this repository, but I'm working on another
  repository I own:
    - [this] https://github.com/fsantanna-no/claude/
    - [work] provided as a GitHub link (see below)
- Never commit to `[this]`. Never create pull requests in `[this]`.
- When I ask you to read this workflow, I'll provide either:
    - A repository link: `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>`
    - An issue link: `https://github.com/<user>/<repo>/issues/<N>`
    - An issue link already identifies the repository.
- Ask me for the plan name (see `CLAUDE.md` / Persistent Plans).
    - The plan should be added to `.claude/plans/<plan>.md`.
- The goal is to fix or prompt and make a pull request (PR) to `[work]`:
    - Ask me for credentials when about to create the PR.
- Clone the `[work]` repository locally:
    - It must persist during the whole session.
- Create a new PR for each new or split task that we discuss in separate.
- Before a PR, pull main branch to check if there are any glitches.
- Always use English:
    - In all answers, comments, code, or any other kind of output.
    - Even is I write in Portugues, everything must translate to English.
