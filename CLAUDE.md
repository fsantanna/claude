# Code Style

- 80-column lines
- Indentation:
    - 4 spaces
- Comments:
    - only before blocks or functions, never in between lines
    - if a line requires comments, create an explicit block for the related
      lines and comment on top
- Ifs:
    - always use else, even if the true case returns
    - both paths should be clear with proper indentation

# Extra

- After each instruction, and before editing files, you are allowed to make
  one-line suggestions.
- Update `CLAUDE.md` when necessary.
